## Pusher Configuration
In order to be able to send message in realtime, we need to use a two-way interactive communication tools (like pusher or socket.io). In this case, we are going to use pusher.
1. Visit [pusher.com](https://pusher.com)
2. Create an account or login with your Google/Github account.
3. Select `Channels`

	- Name doesn't have to be same as your project repository's
	- Select a cluster that is closest to your location
	- Choose `vue.js` as frontend and `laravel` as backend
